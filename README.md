# Time Reposting System :clock1:


The project's golf was to get familiar with both backend and front end design using the most common JavaScript frameworks.

### Backend :cloud:

The backend was designed using the Node.js framework. To run the server, you will need to move to the server directory, install the necessary packages using ```npm install``` and then open the server with the ```npm start```


### Frontend :computer:

The front end is run using the React.js framework. To run the front-end's debug version, you will need to install the packages using ```npm install``` and run the client using ```npm start```.

### Data management :blue_book:

All of the data is managed using JSON files. The project goal was to get familiar with JavaScript, so I did not want to dive into any SQL databases.
